# Project: StepX - E-commerce Landing Page Design

This is a high-fidelity e-commerce landing page concept for "StepX," a curated sneaker store. This project was designed in Figma as a personal challenge to apply and practice fundamental UI/UX design principles.

## Project Goal

The objective was to design a clean, modern, and conversion-focused desktop landing page. The design emphasizes a premium, trustworthy brand identity for a store that sells major brands like Nike, Adidas, and New Balance.

## Design Tools
* **Figma**

## Key Features of the Design
* **Strong Hero Section:** Uses a powerful headline ("Find Your Signature") and a clear call-to-action.
* **Trust-Building Elements:** A "Why Choose StepX" section to build customer confidence.
* **Curated Product Grid:** A clean "Featured Products" section that showcases a *variety* of brands.
